#Testing scripts for trained MSD networks on remote sensing data to compute segmentation accuracies

# This script carries out the testing of MSD networks on the remote sensing based testing data
# The results are the csv files in the results/RemoteSensing/quantitative/ folder

# The code assumes that the MSD networks are trained and available in the scripts/RemoteSensing/training/MSD/PartiallyOverlapping(True/False)/ folders
# It also assumes the (testing) datasets to be available in the /data/RemoteSensingDatasets/PartiallyOverlapping(True/False)/ folders
